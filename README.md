Planet decision is a project to explore a full stack Javascript development. It's a technology demo that incorporates several Javascript libraries including:

Client
-	React
-	D3

- Sass
- VanillaJS

Server
-	Koa
-	Mongoose
-	Mongo
-	JWT

Data
-	Cheerio

### Client
The client consists of the main application interface and an admin interface:
-	The admin interface is protected by user login and JWT's.
	-	It provides a simple way to edit planetary data, including associating "answers" to planets.
-	The main interface is an active animation of planets.
	-	It currently displays the Solar system, but it is capable of displaying any system, including binary systems.
	-	It provides a single "Question" field that once clicking "Ask" runs an animation and provides an answer.

### Server
The server is a simple API that hosts the planetary data. It includes a seeding script that derives it's data from a JSON file that is generated by the scraping script.

### Data
Planetary data was scraped from Wikipedia via Cheerio.
